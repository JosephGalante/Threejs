# My Journey with Three.js

Learning 3D Web Development through a [45-hour online course](https://threejs-journey.com/) taught by field expert Bruno Simon.

His stuff is insane. Check out his [website](https://www.bruno-simon.com) (not a paid advertisement or endorsement, I just think his work is incredible, and I figured I could learn a thing or two from him).
